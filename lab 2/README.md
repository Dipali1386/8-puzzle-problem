## 1. Tic Tac Toe

**Description:**  
A simple C++ program to play Tic Tac Toe between a player and the computer or between two players.  
The program uses a 3×3 grid with positions marked 1–9. Players take turns marking spaces until one wins or the game ends in a draw.

**Key Concepts:**
- 2D array/1D array representation of board
- Player move validation
- Checking win, draw conditions
- Turn-based game loop

##  Water Jug Problem

<pre>
Description:
A program that solves the classic Water Jug Problem where you are given two jugs of different capacities and must measure an exact amount of water using only these jugs.
The solution uses either:

BFS (Breadth First Search), or

A simple step-by-step procedural logic.

Key Concepts:

State representation as (x, y) where x is water in Jug1 and y is water in Jug2

Goal state checking

Applying rules to transition between states

Avoiding repeated states

##  Magic Square Problem

<pre>
Description:
A program to generate a Magic Square of size n × n (where n is odd).
A magic square is an arrangement of numbers from 1 to n² such that:

The sum of each row, column, and both main diagonals is the same.

Algorithm Used:

Siamese method (also known as De la Loubère method) for odd n.

Key Concepts:

2D array indexing

Modular arithmetic to wrap rows/columns

Filling numbers based on fixed movement rules
